## Appearance

Exterior: Very woods-like and nature in exterior. 2 story high building with 4 tree pillars. Each pillar grows upwards and meets the other trees in a domelike fashion (egg-like).

Interior: Rare plants that don't belong in this area. Vines covered the door. Porcelain deer with antlers raised, fountains. Curved staircases lead to the 2nd floor. Very court-like but druidic and well kept.
