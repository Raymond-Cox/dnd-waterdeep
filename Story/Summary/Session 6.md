The session begins with the party aiding [[Yagra]] from the Kankous attack. They then realize [[Zigz]] is missing. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] helps [[Yagra]] skin and pack bird wings out of the sewer, while [[Vellia]] begins searching for [[Zigz]].

Vellia finds a Kankou carrying [[Zigz]] away and begins chasing it down. Meanwhile, [[Yagra]] and [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] meet [[Rizzler]] outside of the sewer and decide to go back in search of [[Vellia]]. They discover the chase across the sewer, and rush to aid [[Vellia]]. The party eventually corners the Kankou, which then tosses [[Zigz]] into the deep sewer water and attempts to escape. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] and [[Yagra]] chase down and execute the Kankou, while [[Vellia]] and [[Rizzler]] rescue the drowning [[Zigz]].

Afterwards the party heads back to the [[Yawn'en Portal]] with the bird wings in tow. [[Yagra]] returns the bounty to her employer. Meanwhile [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] strikes up a deal with [[Durden]] to house [[Yagra]] at [[The Honored Legacy]]. [[Durden]] gives the party a cask of beer in an attempt to keep [[Yagra]] there. The party rolls the cask back to [[The Honored Legacy]] and retires for the night.

The next day the party splits. [[Yagra]] and [[Vellia]] have their own thing, while Flamehair and Rizzler set out to hunt scarecrows for [[(Druid Quest) Scarecrows]].

## Flamehair/Rizzler
The duo set out through the northern gate and begin sweeping the countryside for signs of scarecrows. After a couple of hours, they locate one and defeat it in battle. They search for another for upwards of 4 hours, then resort to a change in tactic. They move towards the nearby woods where [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] feeds and communicates to the nearby animals. After asking a sparrow where they can find a larger bird, the sparrow flies towards Waterdeep's walls and is attacked by a falcon.

They rush towards the location of the falcon, and [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] calls it down to him. It flies downward and lands on [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] arm, piercing the skin with it's talons. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] takes the falcon back to the field with the deceased scarecrow in an attempt to show the falcon what to look for. The falcon takes back to the skies and leads the duo back to the south.

The duo comes upon a second scarecrow, and engages in battle. [[Rizzler]] coats the scarecrow in oil, and [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] ignites it with tinder. They set the scarecrow ablaze, and it flees through the vineyard setting everything ablaze and spreading fire like crazy. After they execute the scarecrow, [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] shapeshifts into a horse and the duo flees to the southern gate of Waterdeep.

They are stopped at the gate by [[Philip Einhardt]], who questions [[Rizzler]] on suspicion of starting the fire. Eventually they are allowed to pass into Waterdeep, but [[Philip Einhardt]] is highly suspicious of the situation.

The duo travel north up the main road and eventually come across [[Vellia]] floating upwards into the sky. Suddenly [[Vellia]] stops floating upwards and begins falling rapidly. The duo spring into action, [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] bucks [[Rizzler]] into the air towards the building [[Vellia]] is floating above. [[Rizzler]] acrobats her way on top of the house. 

[[Rizzler]] attempts to cast feather-fall onto [[Vellia]] as she approaches the rooftop, but narrowly fails. [[Vellia]] crashes through the roof, and downwards through the building. She lies nearly dead on the ground floor of the building, then the Tiefling wife from [[Session 4]] steps forward and sinks a knife into her throat, ending her life.
