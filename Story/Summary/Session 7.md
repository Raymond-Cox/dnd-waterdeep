We run from the scene of the crime (the roof crash in), and head to the [[Yawn'en Portal]]. [[Durden]] gives [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] another keg for [[Yagra]]. [[Rizzler]] goes upstairs to discuss business with [[Davil Starsong]]. After she admits she was behind the farmland fire, he gets upset and tells her to lay low.

We roll the keg back to  [[The Honored Legacy]]. We run into [[Zigz]] at the bar, but can't understand him. We retire for the night without much else happening. The next morning we met [[Galia]] in the tavern around breakfast. She helped us communicate with [[Zigz]]. We told him that [[Vellia]] died yesterday. He didn't seem to really mind.

[[Flamehair Frostbeard]] and [[Rizzler]] spent the day at [[The Honored Legacy]]. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] bartended and made some wine, while [[Rizzler]] loitered with patrons.

Cats surround the tavern. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] talks to them and discovers that the fire burnt down a lot of the forest. It also destroyed the [[Emerald Enclave]] and killed [[Melannor Felbranch]]. This news depresses [[Flamehair Frostbeard]], who decides to go commune in nature to atone for his sins.

[[Flamehair Frostbeard]] and [[Rizzler]] go out into the forest together. They gather acorns and plant them in the burnt lands in attempt to begin the re-forestation. They camp out in the forest that night. The next morning they wake and feed the homeless transients goodberries and create water for them.
