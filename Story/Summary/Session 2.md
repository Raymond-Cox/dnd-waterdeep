While leaving, the party is flanked by guards at [[Candle Lane Warehouse]]. They decide to jump out of a window to avoid being trapped.  They are pursued into the bay, and attempt to escape by swimming. The guard fire bows towards the party. [[Vellia]] is hit with multiple arrows, falling to critical life. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] doubles back, raising her back up. The guard demand them to halt. [[Vellia]] surrenders, while [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] continues swimming away.
   
[[Flamehair Frostbeard]] reaches safety to the east, then finds his way back to [[Yawn'en Portal]]. [[Vellia]] is captured by the guard in a boat. The guard strips her of all weapons, and knock her out. When she comes to, she is in an undisclosed location. [[Renahr Neverember]] is there, and convinces the group to let her live, stating the deed is done, a life for a life. They leave [[Vellia]] almost dead in the sandy hills.

[[Vellia]] is then flanked by Kankous. She flees down the streets until a guard patrols shows up to deal with the Kankous. Then [[Vellia]] hides in the garbage for a while before making her way back to the tavern.
  
After [[Vellia]] returns to the [[Yawn'en Portal]], [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] patches her up. After recovery they set out towards the town gates towards the north east in search of shops and farms.  The party stops by [[Steam and Steel]] and purchase a new Greatsword for [[Vellia]]. They then enlist the services of [[Vincent Trench]] to find information or whereabouts regarding the kidnapping of [[Floon Blagarn]].

The party leaves the city to venture out into the farm lands. [[Vellia]] shows a provacative painting of Tiefling to a Tiefling child, and then is promptly chased away from the small village by parents.
After venturing south, they come across a vineyard. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] swiftly steals a fine bottle of wine from the owner, who is old and mostly blind. On the way back into town they meet [[Philip Einhardt]], who requests [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] tell him what he learns from his spiritual journey.

After the party returns to the [[Yawn'en Portal]], they are met by [[Vincent Trench]]. Vincent advises the party that [[Floon Blagarn]] was seen taken into the sewers. The party should search for a specific symbol to navigate through the sewers.

[[Flamehair Frostbeard]] shares the fine wine with [[Yagra]] and [[Durden]]. The party asks [[Yagra]] to accompany them into the sewers in search of [[Floon Blagarn]], which she happily accepts. [[Yagra]] lends [[Vellia]] a mace.
