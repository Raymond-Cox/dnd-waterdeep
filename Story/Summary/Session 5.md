The sessions starts off in [[The Honored Legacy]], where [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] spends the day brewing beer while [[Vellia]] does some shopping. Later that evening we are attacked by 4 Kankous who break in through the 3rd floor windows. After defeating the Kankous, we find a parchment with directions to kill [[Vellia]] for being a pervert.

The next day [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] commissions the builder guild to repair the window damage. Afterwards he goes to [[Phaulkonmere]]. At [[Phaulkonmere]] he meets [[Melannor Felbranch]] who tasks him with [[(Druid Quest) Scarecrows]]. She bestows a symbol circle with a tree on his hand, which acts as a boon.

After [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] returns to [[Yawn'en Portal]], the party sets out to visit [[Rashawl]] to inquire about some paper birds. His cost is 50 gold per bird, so the party passes.

The party then realizes they forgot [[Zigz]] at the [[Yawn'en Portal]], so they return to search for him. They cannot find him at the tavern, so they begin searching the streets. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] shapeshifts into a Mastiff and sniffs out [[Zigz]], who was hiding in a random alleyway.

Afterwards [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] sniffs out [[Yagra]] which leads to a sewer grate. After entering he leads the party towards [[Yagra]], who is in combat with some Kankous. The party helps Yagra defeat the Kankous, then they notice [[Zigz]] is gone again.
