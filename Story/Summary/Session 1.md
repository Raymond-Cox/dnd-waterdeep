The starting party consists of [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] and [[Vellia]].

Our adventure begins by moving north through WaterDeep towards the [[Yawn'en Portal]]. We encounter a bar brawl break out, and aid [[Yagra]]. Afterwards, we are approached by [[Volothamp Gedearm]], who propositions us to rescue his friend [[Floon Blagarn]]. The party agrees and sets out towards the Dock Ward to hunt for leads.

The party firsts checks the [[Skewered Dragon]] for clues. They gather information from the patrons that verifies [[Volothamp Gedearm]]s last known whereabouts of [[Floon Blagarn]].
