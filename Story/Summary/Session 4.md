The party searches the hideout for treasure, finding a small amount. More importantly they discover two additional paths. One leads down a narrow tunnel to a room containing Wererats. The other leads through a false wall into the basement of a Tiefling family home. The party has an altercation with the Tiefling wife, leading to [[Zigz]] getting pierced by a thrown kitchen knife.

The party returns to the [[Yawn'en Portal]] with the injured [[Zigz]] and [[Floon Blagarn]]. [[Vellia]] puts [[Zigz]] to bed to rest and recover, while [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] returns [[Floon Blagarn]] to [[Volothamp Gedearm]]. [[Volothamp Gedearm]] doesn't have the 200 dragons promised as reward, but instead offers a deed to an abandoned tavern in the North Ward called [[Trollskull Manor]].

The next day [[Volothamp Gedearm]] and [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] go to inspect [[Trollskull Manor]]. Flamehair accepts the tavern as suitable payment as the quest reward. [[Volothamp Gedearm]] instructs the tavern would require roughly 1000 dragons to renovate. He also advises against attempting to renovate yourself, else gain the unwanted attention of the local guilds who are known to break limbs over these sorts of things.

[[Flamehair Frostbeard]] talks to [[Durden]] about [[Trollskull Manor]]. [[Durden]] reinforces the narrative that it is indeed haunted. [[Durden]] advises a man named [[Rashawl]] might know a thing or two about ghosts. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] visits [[Rashawl]], but passes on purchasing a book on spectres.

The party decides to visit [[Trollskull Manor]] at night to attempt to find the ghost. Despite the ghosts warnings to leave, [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] attempts to communicate with the ghost. The ghost cannot speak, but writes in dust. The ghost reveals himself to be [[Lif]], the original tavern owner. [[Lif]] haunts the tavern scaring away any new owners that he deems unfit to continue the legacy he built for the bar.

[[Flamehair Frostbeard]] convinces [[Lif]] he will uphold the legacy of the tavern, and will collaborate with [[Lif]] to make it a place they are both proud of. [[Lif]] agrees and views [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] as a worthy new owner of the tavern. [[Lif]] rewards [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] with his life savings of 650 dragons to put towards renovating the manor.

The next day [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] visits the local guilds to start renovating the tavern. Renovations begin on 12th of Ches, and are set to be completed by the 24th. During the tavern renovations, the party indulges in various activities to pass the time.

[[Vellia]] spends the next 10 days bonding with [[Zigz]]. It goes well, [[Zigz]] really takes to [[Vellia]], becoming quickly attached. [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] picks up a book on brewing, spending his time meditating in nature while learning the brewing arts. 

While studying, [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] meets a cat who delivers a druidic animal message to come to [[Phaulkonmere]] to make contact with the [[Emerald Enclave]]. Afterwards [[Flamehair Frostbeard]] convinces the cat to live with him at [[Trollskull Manor]]. The cat agrees.

The tavern is re-opened on the 22nd of Ches under the name [[The Honored Legacy]].
